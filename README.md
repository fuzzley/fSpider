Just a simple Pong clone, written in javascript. 
The project utilizes [KineticJS](http://http://phaser.io/) as the game engine.
The [latest version of the game](http://fuzzley.info/pong/) is hosted on http://fuzzley.info/pong/. You may have to clear your cache to see changes. If you find any problems, or if you'd like to see a feature implemented, please let me know :).

Have fun!
